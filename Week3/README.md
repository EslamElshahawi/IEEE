# A comparison between IP and MAC


| Address Type   | Structure | Usage | Location in the network layers |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| IP  | 32 bits of 4 decimal numbers seperated by periods each number is an octet of 8 bits   | Logical addressing and communication between different networks in the network layer as the packet is being routed across different networks using IP(internet protocol) | Ip addresses are part of the network layer and are responsible for logical addressing and routing to the correct network and device |
| MAC | 48 bits of 6 hexadecimal numbers seperated by colons and each number is 8 bits as 2 hexadecimal digits    | It identifies every device uniqeuly as the MAC address comes with every network interface card (NIC) assigned by the hardware manufacturer so it can't be changed unlike IP and it addresses devices physically and only used for local communication  | MAC Addresses are a part of the data-link layer and are used to communicate in the same local network as they physically address every device    |
